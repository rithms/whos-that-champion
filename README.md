# Who's That Champion? - URF Version

'Who's That Champion? - URF Version' is an interactive game and web application designed for the first Riot Games API Challenge.

The rules are simple:
  - Analyze the match details that are given to you.
  - Guess which champion the data is from (based soley on analysis, problem solving, and guesstimations).
  - See how many you can get right in a row, and brag to your friends!

  It may sound like a cake walk, but you'd be surprised how challenging it can be with a URF game mode's meta.
 
We have collected data from over 85,000 URF mode games, so you're sure to get a unique match every time you play.

PS: URF Version is the first and probably only version of "Who's That Champion?" ever. There will never and can never be a version better than URF.
