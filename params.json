It ran as a long running process until URF mode was \r\nmade unavailable. Each matchId from a batch was stored as a document in a matchIds collection in the database.\r\n\r\nA [match details daemon](https://github.com/rithms/whos-that-champion/blob/master/FlaskApp/FlaskApp/daemon/match_details_d.py) was created to retrieve the match details of every matchId found in the database via the Riot Games API. The necessary match\r\ndata needed for the web app was parsed from the data returned from the Riot Games API and made into a document. This document was then stored in the\r\nmatches collection in the database.\r\n\r\nA [static data script](https://github.com/rithms/whos-that-champion/blob/master/FlaskApp/FlaskApp/scripts/static_data.py) was created and run one time. The script retrieved static data for champions, spells, and items via the Riot API.\r\nThe necessary data for the web app was parsed and made into a document, which was then stored in the database to their respective collections. Namely, the champions, items, and spells collections of the database.\r\n\r\nNow that URF is over, none of these scripts need to be run, as all data is up to date in relation to the stored matches.\r\n\r\n### Data Model\r\n\r\nMatchId documents were stored in the MatchIds collection.\r\n\r\nAn example of a matchId document's structure can be seen [here](http://whosthatchampion.com/example_matchId_document/).\r\n\r\n\r\nMatch documents were stored in the Matches collection.\r\n\r\nAn example of a match document's structure can be seen [here](http://whosthatchampion.com/example_match_document/).\r\n\r\n\r\nChampion documents were stored in the Champions collection.\r\n\r\nAn example of a champion document's structure can be seen [here](http://whosthatchampion.com/example_champion_document/).\r\n\r\n\r\nSpell documents were stored in the Spells collection.\r\n\r\nAn example of a spell document's structure can be seen [here](http://whosthatchampion.com/example_spell_document/).\r\n\r\n\r\nItem documents were stored in the Items collection.\r\n\r\nAn example of a item document's structure can be seen [here](http://whosthatchampion.com/example_item_document/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nThis project is now open source now that the API Challenge is over.\r\nIf you would like to contribute to this project please open an issue, or send a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n\"Who's That Champion?\" isn’t endorsed by Riot Games and doesn’t reflect the views or opinions \r\nof Riot Games or anyone officially involved in producing or managing League of Legends.
